# K-Means Clustering using Hadoop and MapReduce

A mini project for the K-Means Clustering implementation using Hadoop and MapReduce wiwth the help of MRJob library.
Part of HCMUT Data Mining course.

1. Programming Tool: Visual Studio Code
2. Language: Python
3. Frameworks/Libraries: Hadoop, MRJob
4. Goal: Implement the K-Means Clustering and deploy in local/Hadoop Cluster/Dataproc

Note:
* The details for implementation are all inside the path: `/src`
* The scatter plots will be stored in `/images` after running `dataGenerator.py`
